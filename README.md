# Spotisync

This is an early prototype that allows you to fork spotify playlist
and add any new changes to your own lists
This way you won't have to choose between your favourites and that great
frequently maintained user playlist

I had some fun using fast APIs UI as a way to aunthenticate yourself using your spotify
credentials in the same way that you would with any API key when requiered by swagger
but this will probably change back into regular variables again.. don't judge
